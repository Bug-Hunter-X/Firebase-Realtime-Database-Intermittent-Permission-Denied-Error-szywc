# Firebase Realtime Database Intermittent Permission Denied Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue in Firebase Realtime Database: intermittent "Permission denied" errors despite properly configured security rules.  The issue's unpredictability makes debugging challenging. This example provides a scenario to reproduce and a potential solution.  Read the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files for details.

**Problem:** The `bug.js` file shows how data access can randomly fail with a permission denied error, even with permissive rules. This happens seemingly at random, making it difficult to isolate the cause.

**Solution:** The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential fix using Firebase's `onDisconnect()` method for robust data management, especially in scenarios involving concurrent updates or network interruptions, which might cause the problem. 

**Note:**  The root cause might be related to network latency, client-side caching, or race conditions during concurrent database operations.  The provided solution focuses on making the application more resilient to such issues, not necessarily solving the underlying root cause.
